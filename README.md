# XR Defense

This repository hosts the BURGS Project "Spatial Seer: Exploiting Telemetry to Expose XR User Environment". This repository hosts the team's work to investigate how performance metrics can be exploited to expose an XR user's location type. The project utilizes the Magic Leap 2 and Meta Quest 3. We used Unity to develop our entrypoint for our cyber attack.
